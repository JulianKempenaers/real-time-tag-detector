#first time installation:
#------------------------
#1. add the live_qr_scanner_folder folder to your desktop or documents folder (not on external drive) of your Raspberry Pi

#2. find the 'run_installer.sh' file. double click and select 'execute in terminal'
#this will not work if you are not connected to the internet


#using code after installation:
#-------------------------------
#1. Decide whether you want to use RecentId Colour Coding (RICC) or not (nRICC). 

#2. Optionally open the code to edit some modifiable variables (see more details on modifiable variables below)

#3.locate 'run_stag_with_RecentIdColourCoding.sh' or 'run_stag_without_RecentIdColourCoding.sh' file in the live_qr_scanner_folder

#4. double click it and press 'execute in terminal'

#5. hit 'Esc' to close the live detector


#Modifiable variables:
#----------------------
#n_cols:
This code keeps track of the n most recently detected tags and colour codes them. 
This means that even if they move out of frame for a few seconds, they will still 
have the same colour when they return. n_cols enables changing how many other tags
can be detected before this one is forgotten.

#stag_libraries:
Various libraries of STags exist. Here you must specify which STags you're using 
so that the code can detect them.


#display_height and display_width:
This applies to the size of the output screen.

#normalise_view (True or False)
Normalising view can improve contrast within the image, including contrast of tags.
However sometimes it can increase false detection rates. 

#WIDTH and HEIGHT
These determine the resolution of the captured images. 
If STags take up a small part of your image, you may want to capture in higher resolution.

#SHUTTERUS and GAIN
These are picamera2 specific settings for exposure and gain of the captured image
