# Real-Time STag Detector

A lightweight Python tool for real-time detection and tracking of STag markers. It displays camera output with tag information overlaid live on the video stream. 

### What are STags?

STags, designed by Manfred Stoiber, are used for motion tracking of animals.  This **real-time STag detector** (this repository) was developed as a tool to display detected tags in real-time, allowing for a **live view of the tags** rather than having to analyze them after the recording process.
